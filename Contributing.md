# Contributing to CHAOSS Event DEI Badging

Thank you for considering contributing! This project thrives on diverse contributions—not just code. We welcome improvements to documentation, automation, reviews, design, and more.


## 1. Ways to Contribute

You can help in multiple ways:

* **Code & Automation** — writing scripts, implementing features, fixing bugs
* **Documentation** — improving guides, README, contributing docs, tutorials
* **Reviewing Applications** — volunteering as a reviewer/badger for the event DEI badging
**Issue Reporting & Discussion** — raising issues, proposing ideas, participating in conversations.



## 2. Getting Started / Local Setup

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork locally.
2. Install dependencies (if any) — e.g., Python packages used by automation scripts.
3. Run scripts locally to confirm behavior (for instance, `scripts/update_reviewers.py`).
4. Open a branch for your change (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`).


## 3. Contribution Guidelines

* Use a clear, descriptive commit message (e.g., `feat: add X feature` / `fix: correct Y bug`).
* Prefer small, focused pull requests.
* If your change affects existing scripts or docs, include or update tests / examples / docs.
* Respect the existing code style and structure.
* Always link to relevant issue(s), or explain in your PR what you are solving.


## 4. Feature-Specific Contributions

### Reviewer Spotlight

The **Reviewer Spotlight** is a feature that recognizes reviewers in the DEI badging program. It is auto-generated and should **not** be manually edited in the README. See the [reviewer spotlight documentation](docs/reviewer-spotlight-overview.md) for full details.

**Important:**
Any content between these markers in `README.md` is overwritten by automation:

```md
<!-- REVIEWER_SPOTLIGHT_START -->
<!-- REVIEWER_SPOTLIGHT_END -->
```

Do not make manual edits inside those markers.



## 5. Code of Conduct

This project abides by the [CHAOSS Code of Conduct](https://chaoss.community/code-of-conduct). Please be respectful and collaborative in all interactions.



## 6. Getting Help & Contact
