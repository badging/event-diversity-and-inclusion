# DEI Event Badging
DEI Event Badging focuses on the experience of the event attendees, speakers, and sponsors (everyone present at the event). It is focused on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion in open source events.

## Metrics for Event badging
The following are the approved metrics for DEI Event Badging:

### Event Demographics
**To what extent does an event consider and pay attention to the attendees, speakers, and volunteers’ demographics?**  
An event with diverse demographics indicates the potential for different viewpoints, broader perspective, and representation at the event. Everyone has different points of view, and understanding each demographic's viewpoint helps us determine if they are feeling excluded. To protect the privacy of attendees, speakers, and volunteers, demographic data collected at an event should be kept private.

#### Objectives
Event Demographics metric aim to accomplish the following objectives:
* Determine if the groups of speakers are diverse when grouped by keynotes, sessions, and tracks.
* Provide the event organizer with information about the diversity (including gender, age, race, and disability) of speakers, volunteers, and attendees.
* Discover less-visible stories concerning the intersectionality of the speaker demographic data
* Help retain attendees, speakers, and volunteers from diverse backgrounds for future events.
* Determine if keynote, track, and session selection committees are diverse.

### Diversity Access Ticket
**How are Diversity Access Tickets used to support diversity and inclusion for an event?**  
Creating specific tickets for different groups of attendees would help diversify the demographics of an event. Diversity access tickets can encourage new members to join events and enable community members to attend events. This metric would help unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise economically disadvantaged people to attend events.

A common example is offering discounted or free access tickets to students.

#### 
Diversity Access Tickets aim to accomplish the following objectives:
* Demonstrate the effectiveness of increasing diversity at events.
* Providing a discount to attendees who could not attend without one.
* Encourage members from underrepresented groups to attend.
* Track the effectiveness of outreach efforts.

### Family Friendliness
**How does enabling families to attend together support diversity and inclusion of the event?**  
Implementing Family Friendliness metrics at events can help encourage some demographic to attend the event by allowing them to bring their family. This may include childcare, activities for children, or tracks at the event targeted at youths and families.

#### Objectives
Family Friendliness matric aims to accomplish the following objectives:
* Enable the event organizers to know whether an event is inclusive for attendees with families.
* An event organizer wants to know whether inviting people who are caregivers knows about the availability of these family-oriented activities.
* Allow parents, guardians, or caretakers of children under the age of 18 to decide whether or not to bring their children.
* A parent, guardian, or caregiver, with children under the age of 18, with no option, but to bring their children, and evaluate their ability to attend as a family.

### Event Accessibility
**To what extent does your event accommodate those with various accessibility needs?**  
The Importance of Venue/Platform Accessibility and accommodation of special needs at in-person and virtual events can not be overlooked. Not only do organizers want an event to be as inclusive as possible, but in many locations, it is the event organizer’s legal responsibility to address and provide equal access.

#### Objectives
This metric aims to empower and accommodate event attendees with specific accessibility needs to make the right decision for them on whether the event is inclusive to their needs. Depending on the size of the event as well as the financial and implementation constraints accessibility at an event may include:
* Captioning in live stream and in-person settings
* Sign language interpreters
* Sighted guides at the event
* Wheelchair access etc.

### Time Inclusion for virtual events
**How can organizers of virtual events be mindful of attendees and speakers in other time zones?**  
Time inclusion and global accessibility of attendees from different Timezones at an event are vital. This metric is accomplished by providing attendees and speakers inclusive ways to participate virtually in real-time while also providing methods for presenting, viewing, and taking part in event discussions asynchronously.

#### Objectives
Time Inclusion metric aims to accomplish the following objectives:
* Enable all participants to benefit equally from virtual events. 
* Help event organizers develop a reasonable method to ensure those in different time zones feel included virtually. 
* Ensure support for participation from different time zones during an event. 

### Code of Conduct at Event
**How does the Code of Conduct for events support diversity and inclusion?**  
A Code of conduct describes a set of rules that must be observed by the event participants and the consequences of breaking these set of rules. Event participants are empowered to report incidences and proactively help mitigate situations of unruly behavior.

#### Objectives
Implementing a code of conduct at an open source event will achieve the following objectives: 
* Ensure event organizers have effective processes in place to deal with misbehaving attendees.
* Ensure that participants have a positive event experience.
* Ensure that participants know how to report offensive behavior.
* Assure event participants of their safety.

### Inclusive Experience at Event
**To what extent does an event organizing team commit to an inclusive experience at an event?**  
Inclusive Experience at event metric enables participants to feel included and welcomed at events. It focuses on the work by event organizers to create an inclusive experience for participants at the events and the outcomes from that work.

#### Objectives
Inclusive Experience metric aims to accomplish the following objectives:
* Enable event organizers to ensure all attendees are welcomed and included at events.
* Encourage event organizers to build inclusivity into the event to provide a sense of belonging.
* Provide methods to measure inclusion in experience at an event.
