# Badging workflow
Badging for events can be applied to in-person, virtual, or hybrid (in-person and virtual combined) events. These can be seen in the [diversity and inclusion page](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/) on the CHAOSS website.

Every event badged by the CHAOSS project DEI working group follows the workflow below:
* Filtered by the type of event, the event organizer chooses the type of event form to fill — In-person Event or Virtual event.
* Events applying for a CHAOSS D&I badge should fill in the submission form — this form must be filled out by the event organizer.
* After the form is filled and submitted, the event organizer opens an issue under the corresponding GitHub repository, and waits for reviewers to give feedback.
* Reviewers will be randomly assigned according to the reviewer list. 
* All assigned reviewers should work with the review checklist.
* The diversity, equity, and inclusion measurements that occur during the application and reviewing process are according to DEI metrics defined by CHAOSS.
The initial application for these events is done on the website's CHAOSS DEI badging page and finalized on the GitHub DEI badging repository. **This means that all applicants must have a GitHub account to finish their application and see what badge they got.**

## Badge Levels
Badges are assigned based on the percentage of items they complete on the checklist. Badges aren’t meant to provide judgment, and all badges awarded indicate a desire on the part of the event organizers to center diversity, equity, and inclusion in their event. Larger, more mature events may receive a **Gold Badge**, but smaller events with fewer resources may receive a different badge, and that’s perfectly ok.

The table below shows the badging levels, the badges, and the percentage of requirements met for each.

| Level | Badge |Percentage of Requirements Metric |
| ----------- | ----------- |------------|
| Pending | ![DEI pending badge](pending.svg) | Less than 40% |
| Passing | ![DEI passing badge](passing.svg) | Greater than or equal to 40% and less than 60% |
| Silver | ![DEI silver badge](silver.svg) | Greater than or equal to 60% and less than 80% |
| Gold | ![DEI gold badge](gold.svg) | Greater than 80% |

## Conclusion
The DEI Badging Initiative was created to encourage a more diverse and inclusive environment in the open source ecosystem. Implementation of these badges helps create a safe space for participants of an open source event or contributors to an open source project.
