The DEI Badging initiative is an award system whereby open-source projects and events earn badges based on their commitment to centering diversity, equity, and inclusion in their processes and policies, and the way they build their communities. The feedback received from the reviewers helps open source event organizers and project maintainers enhance their internal processes and events to be more inclusive. The DEI Badging initiative was created to encourage diversity and inclusion of people from different backgrounds in an open source project or event.
